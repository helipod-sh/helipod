# Auth slice A2 — email flows (implementation plan)

For agentic workers: use the `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` skill to execute this plan — each task below is an independently reviewable unit; dispatch one subagent per task, in order.

**Goal:** Give `@stackbase/auth` its email surface — an `EmailProvider` seam (console dev default + Resend production adapter, fully pluggable), plus email verification, password reset, magic-link sign-in, and OTP sign-in. All emailed secrets are SHA-256/base64url hashed at rest (raw code only in the email), sends are action-orchestrated over deterministic mutations, and abuse defenses (per-code attempt counter, per-`(email,flow)` cooldown, deployment-global send throttle) work without any transport identifiers. Every redeem mints through A1's `mintSession` chokepoint and inherits the A1 session model unchanged.

**Architecture:** The `email` config block (with a required `provider`) extends A1's `defineAuth`; when absent, `makeAuthModules` registers **exactly** the A1 surface (no A2 functions). The send seam straddles the mutation/action boundary (decision 4): the four public `request*` functions are ACTIONS that first `ctx.runMutation("auth:_issueCode", …)` — an internal (`_`-prefixed) mutation that writes the hashed code row + updates throttle counters and COMMITS, returning the raw code + a send-decision — then send the email through the provider. The internal-mutation-from-action call mirrors `scheduler:_enqueue`/`scheduler:_cancel` exactly. The raw code is generated INSIDE `_issueCode` via `node:crypto` (identical precedent to A1's `mintSession` generating the raw session token via `generateToken()` inside a mutation and returning it) — resolving the determinism question below. The four redeem functions are mutations that consume-before-validate (delete the row in the same transaction that validates it) and mint through `mintSession`.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Bun (runtime/pkg-manager), Turborepo, vitest under Node, `@stackbase/values`/`@stackbase/executor`/`@stackbase/component`/`@stackbase/runtime-embedded` engine seams, `@stackbase/errors` typed errors, `node:crypto` for hashing + secret generation, `hash-wasm` argon2id (unchanged from A1), native `fetch` for the Resend adapter (zero deps). Component tests follow the SHIPPED A1 auth idiom (`composeComponents` + `EmbeddedRuntime.create` + `r.run(...)`, injecting a capture provider via `defineAuth({ email: {...} })`), not `createTestStackbase`. The E2E drives a REAL `@stackbase/client` over a REAL WebSocket against a REAL `stackbase dev` server.

## Global Constraints

Binding values copied verbatim from the design spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-12-auth-email-flows-design.md`). Do not relitigate these while implementing:

- **Hashed at rest.** Every emailed secret is SHA-256/base64url hashed (`sha256base64url`, the A1 helper) before commit. `authCodes.codeHash` stores the hash; the raw code exists ONLY in the email and is never persisted or logged. Redeem re-hashes the presented code and compares (constant-time via the index-equality lookup on `codeHash`, plus the cross-account email guard). No raw code in any row or log line.
- **One active code per `(email, flow)`** — `_issueCode` overwrites the previous `(email, flow)` row (via the `byEmailFlow` index) so only the last-issued code is ever valid; a lost email is self-healing.
- **Atomic consume-before-validate.** The redeem mutation deletes/consumes the code row as part of the same transaction that validates it — under single-writer OCC, concurrent redeems of the same code produce exactly one winner. (The winner is the transaction whose delete commits; the loser's read-set conflict re-runs and finds no row → generic invalid.)
- **The send seam straddles mutation/action (decision 4).** `request*` are ACTIONS: (a) `ctx.runMutation("auth:_issueCode", { email, flow })` writes the hashed code + throttle counters and COMMITS, returning `{ send, code?, email }`; (b) if `send`, build the templated message and `await provider.send(...)`; (c) ALWAYS `return { sent: true }`. A code is durably committed before any send is attempted; a failed send throws to the caller and a re-request overwrites. No scheduler dependency.
- **Redeems are mutations minting via `mintSession`.** Reactive revocation and the A1 session model apply unchanged; every successful redeem returns a `MintResult`-shaped value.
- **Where the raw code is generated (RESOLVED — see "Resolved ambiguities").** Generated INSIDE `_issueCode` (the mutation) via `node:crypto`, returned to the action — mirroring how A1's `mintSession` generates the raw session token via `generateToken()` (`randomBytes`) inside a mutation and returns it. The "no `Date.now()`/`Math.random()` in mutations" rule targets `Math.random()` and wall-clock `Date.now()` (use `ctx.now()` for all TTL/cooldown timestamps); `node:crypto` CSPRNG secret generation inside a mutation is A1-established and correct (a re-run on OCC conflict simply mints a fresh unsent secret). ACTIONS may use native `crypto`/`fetch`, but the code is NOT generated action-side — `_issueCode` owns generation so the hash-and-store and the returned raw value can never diverge.
- **Code shapes (decision 13).** OTP = **8 numeric digits** (`crypto.randomInt`, zero-padded; 10^8 space against a 5-attempt budget). magic-link / reset / verify = **32-char base64url** high-entropy tokens (`randomBytes(24).toString("base64url")` → exactly 32 chars, URL-embeddable).
- **TTL defaults:** `otpTtlMs = 10*60*1000` (10min), `magicLinkTtlMs = 60*60*1000` (1h), `resetTtlMs = 60*60*1000` (1h), `verifyTtlMs = 24*60*60*1000` (24h). All overridable in the `email` config block.
- **Per-code attempt counter:** `otpAttempts` (default **5**). A wrong OTP guess increments `authCodes.attempts` via **commit-then-throw** (so the count survives the failed call, same mechanism as A1's lockout); at `otpAttempts` reached the row is DELETED (re-request required). Applies to the OTP flow's guessing defense.
- **Per-`(email, flow)` request cooldown:** `requestCooldownMs` (default **60_000**). `_issueCode` rejects a re-request inside the window since the existing row's `createdAt` with typed `EMAIL_COOLDOWN`.
- **Deployment-global send throttle:** `emailSendsPerMinute` (default **100**, `0` disables). A second named `authCounters` row `"emailSends"` (same single-row windowed pattern as A1's `"anonymousSignIns"`), 60_000ms window, typed `EMAIL_THROTTLED` at the cap. Protects the provider bill and caps enumeration probing.
- **Anti-enumeration (decision 7).** Every `request*` action returns `{ sent: true }` whether or not the account exists. For reset/verify on an unknown email, NO email is sent and NO code row is written (`_issueCode` returns `{ send: false }`), but the response is identical. At redeem, error codes NEVER distinguish "no such account" from "wrong code": both (and expired, and consumed) are the generic `"invalid code"` error.
- **Password reset is a credential boundary (decision 8).** `resetPassword` revokes ALL of the user's sessions (delete over the `byUserId` range) and mints a fresh one in the same transaction. Cross-account guard applies (decision 9).
- **Cross-account guard (decision 9).** A code row records the `email` it was issued for; every redeem asserts the presented (normalized) email matches the row — a reset code can never act on a different account. Adopted from convex-auth `Password.ts:196`.
- **Unverified-account adoption clears the password (decision 10).** When magic-link/OTP sign-in adopts a pre-existing PASSWORD account whose `users.emailVerified` was never true, the password credential (the `accounts` row) is DELETED — otherwise a pre-registrant keeps a backdoor into the account the mailbox owner now legitimately controls. Adopted from better-auth `magic-link.test.ts:268`.
- **First mailbox proof is a credential boundary (adjudicated amendment, extends decision 10).** ANY flow that flips `users.emailVerified` from unset/false to true (`verifyEmail`, `signInWithMagicLink`, `signInWithOtp`) must DELETE ALL of that user's existing sessions (over the `byUserId` range) before minting the new one — not only clear an unverified adopted account's password. Rationale: an attacker who pre-created the unverified account (gated anon-upgrade or plain unverified signUp) and parked a live session would otherwise KEEP that session after the true mailbox owner proves control — better-auth's `revokeUnprovenAccountAccess` revokes sessions for exactly this reason; clearing only the password leaves the parked-session backdoor open. The wipe is gated on the false→true FLIP: an already-verified user signing in via magic/OTP from a second device is normal multi-device sign-in and is NOT wiped. This uniform rule also subsumes the gated-anon-upgrade deferred wipe (resolution 5): `verifyEmail`'s mint-time revocation IS the deferred credential boundary — no special-casing needed. `resetPassword` already revokes all sessions (decision 8), so its `emailVerified: true` composes trivially.
- **verifyEmail ALWAYS mints (decision 12).** Successful `verifyEmail` sets `users.emailVerified: true` and mints a session (mint-shaped result) — proof of mailbox control is sign-in-grade proof, identical to the magic-link posture, with no path-dependence on how the caller arrived.
- **Successful magic-link/OTP sign-in AND successful verifyEmail set `users.emailVerified: true`** (decision 12).
- **`requireEmailVerification` (default FALSE).** When true AND email configured, password `signUp`/`signIn` of an unverified account returns `{ needsVerification: true }` (NO tokens, no I/O in the mutation) and the CLIENT drives the resend by calling the `requestEmailVerification` action. Default false leaves A1 `signUp`/`signIn` behavior byte-identical. Anonymous upgrade (A1) composes: an anonymous user upgrading via `signUp` under the gate gets `needsVerification` and keeps working anonymously until verified.
- **`createUsersOnEmailSignIn` (default TRUE).** magic-link/OTP sign-in creates the user on first use (with `emailVerified: true`). When false, an unknown email follows the anti-enumeration rule (request succeeds `{ sent: true }`, redeem fails generically — `_issueCode` writes no row for an unknown email under this flag).
- **Adapters shipped: console + Resend (decision 14).** `consoleEmail()` is the zero-config dev default (logs the full email incl. code/link to the server console). `resendEmail({ apiKey, baseUrl? })` is the production adapter — ONE `fetch` to the Resend API, ZERO dependencies, throws on non-2xx. Anything else is a custom `{ send }` object. SMTP is a documented nodemailer recipe, not a built-in.
- **`EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED`** — defensive typed error if an A2 function is somehow invoked when `email` config is absent (normally the functions are simply unregistered, so this is belt-and-suspenders).
- **Email config absent → A2 functions NOT registered.** The component surface stays EXACTLY A1's (test this explicitly).
- **Additive schema only.** New table `authCodes`; `users` gains `emailVerified: v.optional(v.boolean())`; `authCounters` gains a second named row (data, not schema). All pass the additive deploy gate (`packages/cli/src/schema-diff.ts` — new table accepted, new optional field accepted).
- **No `Date.now()`/`Math.random()` in mutations** — use `ctx.now()` for TTL/cooldown/window timestamps. `node:crypto` secret generation inside `_issueCode` is the A1-established exception (see the determinism constraint above). Actions may use native `crypto`/`fetch`.
- **Error codes are code-as-message (A1 convention):** `UserError` subclasses whose `.code === .message`; `commitThenThrow(codeString)` for the commit-then-throw path (carries no `.code`, so the code rides as the message). Redeem failures throw a generic `"invalid code"` (a plain `Error`; NEVER a typed code that could distinguish failure modes).
- **E2E through the real server.** `packages/cli/test/auth-email-e2e.test.ts` drives a REAL `@stackbase/client` over a REAL WebSocket against a REAL `stackbase dev` server (`loadProject` + `createEmbeddedRuntime` + `startDevServer`), per the e2e-through-shipped-entrypoint rule — using an in-memory capture provider (test-only) to record sends.
- **Reference code is Apache-2.0 (`.reference/convex-auth`) / MIT (`.reference/better-auth`) — adapt with attribution comments, NEVER copy FSL code.** Cite the adapted case in the test name/comment.
- **Build ordering / dist resolution.** Tests resolve deps via each package's built `dist/`. **After editing a dependency package, run `bun run build` (or `bun run --filter <pkg> build`) before running a dependent's tests** — editing a dep's `src` is a no-op for a dependent until rebuilt. `git checkout` won't revert git-ignored `dist/`.

Verification commands (package names confirmed: `@stackbase/auth`, `@stackbase/client`, `@stackbase/cli`):

```bash
bun run build                              # all packages, topological
bun run typecheck                          # all packages

bun run --filter @stackbase/auth build
bun run --filter @stackbase/auth test
bun run --filter @stackbase/cli test       # includes auth-email-e2e

## Task 1 — EmailProvider seam + config

The `EmailProvider` type, the two shipped adapters (`consoleEmail`, `resendEmail`), the `EmailTemplates` defaults + override merge, the `email` config block extending A1's `AuthConfig`, the `EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED` defensive error, and conditional module registration (email absent ⇒ surface unchanged). Provider unit tests.

### Files
- **Create** `components/auth/src/email/provider.ts` — `EmailProvider`, `EmailMessage`, `consoleEmail`, `resendEmail`.
- **Create** `components/auth/src/email/templates.ts` — `EmailTemplates`, `TemplateArgs`, `defaultTemplates`, `resolveTemplates`.
- **Modify** `components/auth/src/config.ts` — add `EmailConfig`/`EmailOptions`, extend `AuthConfig`/`AuthOptions`/`DEFAULTS`/`resolveAuthConfig`.
- **Modify** `components/auth/src/errors.ts` — add `EmailCooldownError`, `EmailThrottledError`, `EmailNotConfiguredError`.
- **Modify** `components/auth/src/index.ts` — export the provider/template/config surface.
- **Modify** `components/auth/src/functions.ts` — `makeAuthModules` conditional A2 registration stub (real A2 modules land in Tasks 2–4; here only the `if (config.email)` seam + the "surface unchanged" guarantee).
- **Create** `components/auth/test/email-provider.test.ts`.

### Interfaces

`components/auth/src/email/provider.ts`:

```ts
/** The whole send seam — a plain async `send`. No Auth.js provider-object shape (decision: rejected). */

```

`components/auth/src/email/templates.ts`:

```

`components/auth/src/config.ts` — **old code** (verbatim current):

  accessTtlMs: number;
  /** Refresh-token lifetime, sliding on each rotation (default 30d). */

```

> Note the spread ordering in `resolveEmailConfig`: `...opts` includes optional keys as `undefined` when omitted, which would clobber `EMAIL_DEFAULTS`. Implement `resolveEmailConfig` field-by-field with `??` (as `resolveTemplates`/`appName` show) rather than a raw `...opts` spread — the snippet above shows the intent; the implementer must ensure an omitted `otpAttempts` resolves to `5`, not `undefined`. (A `compact`-style filter or explicit `opts.otpAttempts ?? EMAIL_DEFAULTS.otpAttempts` per field.)

`components/auth/src/errors.ts` — **append** (matching the existing `UserError` code-as-message style):

```ts
/** `request*` re-requested inside `requestCooldownMs` of the last issue for this (email, flow). */
export class EmailCooldownError extends UserError {
  override readonly code = "EMAIL_COOLDOWN";
  constructor() { super("EMAIL_COOLDOWN"); }
}
/** Deployment-global `emailSendsPerMinute` cap tripped (spec decision 6). */
export class EmailThrottledError extends UserError {
  override readonly code = "EMAIL_THROTTLED";
  constructor() { super("EMAIL_THROTTLED"); }
}
/** An A2 function invoked while `email` config is absent — defensive; normally unregistered. */
export class EmailNotConfiguredError extends UserError {
  override readonly code = "EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED";
  constructor() { super("EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED"); }
}
```

`components/auth/src/functions.ts` — **old code** (the factory tail, verbatim):

```ts
  return { signUp, signIn, signOut, getUserId, refresh, signInAnonymously, listSessions, revokeSession, revokeOtherSessions };
}
```

`components/auth/src/functions.ts` — **new code** (the conditional seam; the A2 modules themselves are built by helpers landed in Tasks 2–4):

```ts
  const base = { signUp, signIn, signOut, getUserId, refresh, signInAnonymously, listSessions, revokeSession, revokeOtherSessions };
  if (!config.email) return base;                       // email absent ⇒ surface stays EXACTLY A1's
  return { ...base, ...makeEmailModules(config) };       // Tasks 2–4 provide makeEmailModules
}
```

> In Task 1, `makeEmailModules` may be a stub returning `{}` (kept behind the `if` so the "surface unchanged" test passes now); Tasks 2–4 fill it. Alternatively, land `makeEmailModules` empty in Task 1 and grow it — implementer's choice, but the `if (!config.email) return base;` guard and the "surface unchanged" test are Task 1 deliverables.

### Tests (`email-provider.test.ts`)
- `resendEmail`: mock `globalThis.fetch`; assert the request URL (`https://api.resend.com/emails`), `authorization: Bearer <key>`, JSON body (`from`/`to`/`subject`/`text`, `html` only when provided). Attribution: better-auth email-verification route test shape.
- `resendEmail` non-2xx: mocked 422 response → `send` rejects with the status + body in the message.
- `resendEmail` custom `baseUrl`: honored.
- `consoleEmail`: spy `console.log`; assert the output contains `to`/`subject`/the code (dev convenience is deliberate).
- `resolveTemplates`: a partial override replaces only that flow; others keep defaults.
- **Surface-unchanged guarantee** (also assertable here or in Task 2): `makeAuthModules(resolveAuthConfig())` (no email) has EXACTLY the A1 keys (`signUp,signIn,signOut,getUserId,refresh,signInAnonymously,listSessions,revokeSession,revokeOtherSessions`) and none of `requestOtp`/`verifyEmail`/`_issueCode`/etc.

### Verification
```bash
bun run --filter @stackbase/auth build && bun run --filter @stackbase/auth test
```

## Task 2 — `authCodes` core: schema, `_issueCode`, and the `request*` actions

The `authCodes` table + `byEmailFlow` index, `users.emailVerified`, the internal `_issueCode` mutation (normalize, cooldown, global throttle, anti-enum policy, overwrite, hash-and-store, `attempts: 0`, generate-and-return raw code), and the four `request*` ACTIONS wiring `runMutation` → provider send → `{ sent: true }`.

### Files
- **Modify** `components/auth/src/schema.ts` — add `authCodes` + index, add `users.emailVerified`.
- **Create** `components/auth/src/email/codes.ts` — code generation (`generateOtp`, `generateLinkToken`), the shared `authCodes` helpers.
- **Modify** `components/auth/src/functions.ts` — `makeEmailModules(config)` with `_issueCode` + `requestEmailVerification`/`requestPasswordReset`/`requestMagicLink`/`requestOtp`.
- **Create** `components/auth/test/email-issue.test.ts`.

### Interfaces

`components/auth/src/schema.ts` — **old code** (the `users` line + the `authCounters` line, verbatim):

```ts

```
```ts
  authCounters: defineTable({ name: v.string(), windowStart: v.number(), count: v.number() }).index("byName", ["name"]),
```

`components/auth/src/schema.ts` — **new code** (`users` gains `emailVerified`; add `authCodes` after `authCounters`; `authCounters` itself unchanged — the `"emailSends"` row is data):

```ts
  users: defineTable({
    email: v.optional(v.string()),
    anonymous: v.optional(v.boolean()),
    emailVerified: v.optional(v.boolean()),    // A2: set true by magic/otp sign-in + verifyEmail
  }).index("byEmail", ["email"]),
```
```ts
  authCounters: defineTable({ name: v.string(), windowStart: v.number(), count: v.number() }).index("byName", ["name"]),
  // A2 (spec "Schema"): one active hashed code per (email, flow). `byEmailFlow` is the natural key —
  // `_issueCode` overwrites the prior row through it (decision 2), redeems consume-before-validate.
  authCodes: defineTable({

```

`components/auth/src/functions.ts` — **new code** (`makeEmailModules`; imports `action` from `@stackbase/executor`, the code/template helpers, and the new errors). Key shapes:

```ts
type SendDecision = { send: boolean; code?: string; email: string };

function ttlFor(config: AuthConfig, flow: Flow): number {
  const e = config.email!;
  return flow === "otp" ? e.otpTtlMs : flow === "magic" ? e.magicLinkTtlMs : flow === "reset" ? e.resetTtlMs : e.verifyTtlMs;
}

// Whether a row is written at all for this (email, flow) given account existence + flags (decision 7/11).
async function shouldIssue(ctx: MutationCtx, config: AuthConfig, email: string, flow: Flow): Promise<boolean> {
  const [user] = await ctx.db.query("users", "byEmail").eq("email", email).collect();

    return !!user || config.email!.createUsersOnEmailSignIn;
  }

        : undefined;
      const rendered = e.templates[flow]({ appName: e.appName, email: decision.email, code: isTokenFlow(flow) ? undefined : decision.code, url, ttlMs: ttlFor(config, flow) });
      await e.provider.send({ to: decision.email, from: e.from, ...rendered });
    }
    return { sent: true };   // ALWAYS — anti-enumeration (decision 7)
  });
}

return {
  _issueCode,
  requestEmailVerification: requestAction("verify"),
  requestPasswordReset: requestAction("reset"),
  requestMagicLink: requestAction("magic"),
  requestOtp: requestAction("otp"),
  // Task 3 adds the redeem mutations to this object.
};
```

> **Internal-mutation-from-action convention (found, verbatim from `scheduler`):** the action calls `ctx.runMutation("auth:_issueCode", { … })`. `_issueCode` is registered in the module map under key `_issueCode` → path `auth:_issueCode`; the `_` prefix makes it non-client-callable but reachable from an action's `runMutation`, exactly as `components/scheduler/src/facade.ts:307` calls `api.runMutation("scheduler:_enqueue", …)` and `modules.ts` registers `_enqueue`. The action's `ctx.runMutation` routes through `InlineUdfExecutor.runActionFn`'s `run("mutation")` → `invoke(path, …)` (executor.ts:702), which permits `_` paths (public `runtime.run` blocks them; the action path does not — executor.ts:82).

### Tests (`email-issue.test.ts`, capture provider injected via `defineAuth({ email: { provider: capture, from } })`)

Capture provider: `const sent: EmailMessage[] = []; const capture = { async send(m){ sent.push(m); } };` The test extracts the raw code from `sent[i].text` (that is exactly what a real user would do from the email).

- **hashed-at-rest:** after `requestOtp`, privileged-read the `authCodes` row (via a `_admin`/direct store read or a test-only query) → `codeHash` is set, no field equals the raw code from the email.
- **overwrite / only-last-valid:** two `requestOtp` calls (advance clock past cooldown) → exactly ONE `authCodes` row for `(email, otp)`; the first code no longer verifies (Task 3 redeem), the second does.
- **cooldown:** immediate re-request → rejects `/EMAIL_COOLDOWN/`; after `requestCooldownMs` a new code issues.
- **global throttle:** set `emailSendsPerMinute: 2`; 3rd request within the window → `/EMAIL_THROTTLED/`; advance 60s → recovers. Attribution: convex-auth `rateLimit.test.ts`.
- **anti-enum zero-send (verify/reset):** `requestPasswordReset("unknown@x.co")` → returns `{ sent: true }`, `sent.length === 0`, no `authCodes` row written.
- **anti-enum + createUsersOnEmailSignIn:false (magic/otp):** unknown email → `{ sent: true }`, no row, no send.
- **createUsersOnEmailSignIn:true (default):** unknown email `requestMagicLink` → a row IS written and a send captured (user created at redeem, Task 3).

## Task 3 — Redeem mutations

The shared consume-before-validate helper, then `verifyEmail`, `signInWithOtp`, `signInWithMagicLink`, `resetPassword`.

### Files
- **Modify** `components/auth/src/functions.ts` — add the four redeem mutations to `makeEmailModules`'s return, plus a `consumeCode` helper.
- **Create** `components/auth/test/email-redeem.test.ts`.

### Interfaces

```ts
/** Consume-before-validate (decision 3) + cross-account guard (decision 9) + expiry.
 *  Returns the raw-code MATCH outcome; on a NON-OTP mismatch/expiry/absence the row is deleted and
 *  we throw generic invalid. For OTP, the caller handles the attempt counter (commit-then-throw)
 *  BEFORE deleting, so we split: `peekCode` reads + guards; the redeem fn decides delete vs. count. */

// Shared read+guard (no delete yet — the redeem decides consume vs. count):
async function peekCode(ctx: MutationCtx, email: string, flow: Flow, presented: string) {
  const normEmail = normalizeEmail(email);
  const [row] = await ctx.db.query("authCodes", "byEmailFlow").eq("email", normEmail).eq("flow", flow).collect();
  const matches = !!row
    && (row.email as string) === normEmail                       // cross-account guard (belt: key already scopes)
    && ctx.now() <= (row.expiresAt as number)
    && (row.codeHash as string) === sha256base64url(presented);  // index-equality-grade constant-time
  return { row: (row as Record<string, unknown> | undefined) ?? null, normEmail, matches };
}
const INVALID = "invalid code";   // generic, used for wrong/expired/consumed/no-such-account alike (decision 7)
```

**Shared first-proof credential-boundary helper** (the adjudicated uniform rule — every false→true flip revokes all pre-existing sessions before its mint):
```ts
/** First mailbox proof is a credential boundary: when `emailVerified` flips false→true, DELETE ALL
 *  the user's existing sessions (byUserId) — a pre-registrant's PARKED SESSION must not survive the
 *  true mailbox owner proving control (better-auth revokeUnprovenAccountAccess rationale). Gated on
 *  the FLIP: an already-verified user's magic/otp sign-in is normal multi-device and wipes nothing. */
async function markVerifiedRevokingIfFirstProof(ctx: MutationCtx, user: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
  const userId = user._id as string;
  if (user.emailVerified !== true) {
    for (const s of await ctx.db.query("sessions", "byUserId").eq("userId", userId).collect()) {
      await ctx.db.delete(s._id as string);
    }
  }
  await ctx.db.replace(userId, { ...user, emailVerified: true });
}
```

**`verifyEmail(email, code, deviceLabel?)`** — always mints (decision 12); first proof revokes parked sessions (uniform rule):
```ts
const verifyEmail = mutation(async (ctx, { email, code, deviceLabel }: { email: string; code: string; deviceLabel?: string }) => {
  if (!config.email) throw new EmailNotConfiguredError();
  const { row, normEmail, matches } = await peekCode(ctx, email, "verify", code);
  if (!matches) { if (row) await ctx.db.delete(row._id as string); throw new Error(INVALID); }  // expired/wrong → consume + generic
  await ctx.db.delete(row!._id as string);                                                      // consume-before-validate winner
  const [user] = await ctx.db.query("users", "byEmail").eq("email", normEmail).collect();
  if (!user) throw new Error(INVALID);                                                           // verify targets an existing account
  await markVerifiedRevokingIfFirstProof(ctx, user as Record<string, unknown>);                  // flip + credential boundary
  return mintSession(ctx, config, user._id as string, deviceLabel);
});
```

**`resetPassword(email, code, newPassword)`** — credential boundary (decisions 8/9):
```ts
const resetPassword = mutation(async (ctx, { email, code, newPassword }: { email: string; code: string; newPassword: string }) => {
  if (!config.email) throw new EmailNotConfiguredError();
  const { row, normEmail, matches } = await peekCode(ctx, email, "reset", code);
  if (!matches) { if (row) await ctx.db.delete(row._id as string); throw new Error(INVALID); }
  await ctx.db.delete(row!._id as string);
  const [account] = await ctx.db.query("accounts", "byAccount").eq("provider", "password").eq("accountId", normEmail).collect();
  if (!account) throw new Error(INVALID);
  await ctx.db.replace(account._id as string, { ...account, secret: await hashSecret(newPassword), failedAttempts: 0, lockedUntil: 0 });
  const userId = account.userId as string;
  const [user] = [await ctx.db.get(userId)];
  if (user) await ctx.db.replace(userId, { ...user, emailVerified: true });   // a reset proves mailbox control too
  // Revoke ALL sessions (byUserId range, credential boundary — decision 8), then mint fresh.
  for (const s of await ctx.db.query("sessions", "byUserId").eq("userId", userId).collect()) await ctx.db.delete(s._id as string);
  return mintSession(ctx, config, userId);
});
```
> Setting `emailVerified: true` on reset is consistent with decision 12's "proof of mailbox control is proof of mailbox control" — **adjudicated: accepted.** It composes trivially with the uniform first-proof rule because reset ALREADY revokes all sessions unconditionally (decision 8): the credential boundary the flip demands is satisfied by the wipe reset performs anyway, so `resetPassword` needs no `markVerifiedRevokingIfFirstProof` call (its own delete-all + plain `emailVerified: true` replace, as written above, is exactly equivalent).

**`signInWithMagicLink(email, token, deviceLabel?)`** — create-per-flag, adopt-clears-password (decisions 10/11/12):
```ts
const signInWithMagicLink = mutation(async (ctx, { email, token, deviceLabel }: { email: string; token: string; deviceLabel?: string }) => {
  if (!config.email) throw new EmailNotConfiguredError();
  const { row, normEmail, matches } = await peekCode(ctx, email, "magic", token);
  if (!matches) { if (row) await ctx.db.delete(row._id as string); throw new Error(INVALID); }
  await ctx.db.delete(row!._id as string);
  return adoptOrCreateThenMint(ctx, config, normEmail, deviceLabel);   // shared with OTP
});
```

Shared `adoptOrCreateThenMint`:
```ts
async function adoptOrCreateThenMint(ctx: MutationCtx, config: AuthConfig, normEmail: string, deviceLabel?: string): Promise<MintResult> {
  let [user] = await ctx.db.query("users", "byEmail").eq("email", normEmail).collect();
  if (!user) {
    if (!config.email!.createUsersOnEmailSignIn) throw new Error(INVALID);   // unknown email, creation off → generic (decision 11)
    const id = (await ctx.db.insert("users", { email: normEmail, emailVerified: true })) as string;
    return mintSession(ctx, config, id, deviceLabel);
  }
  // Adopt an existing account. If it was NEVER verified, this is the FIRST mailbox proof — a
  // credential boundary: delete any PASSWORD credential (decision 10 — a pre-registrant's password
  // backdoor; attribution: better-auth magic-link.test.ts:268) AND, via the uniform rule, ALL
  // pre-existing sessions (the pre-registrant's PARKED-SESSION backdoor; better-auth
  // revokeUnprovenAccountAccess rationale). An already-verified user skips both — normal
  // multi-device sign-in.
  if (user.emailVerified !== true) {
    for (const a of await ctx.db.query("accounts", "byAccount").eq("provider", "password").eq("accountId", normEmail).collect()) {
      await ctx.db.delete(a._id as string);
    }
  }
  await markVerifiedRevokingIfFirstProof(ctx, user as Record<string, unknown>);   // session wipe on the flip + set true
  return mintSession(ctx, config, user._id as string, deviceLabel);
}
```

**`signInWithOtp(email, code, deviceLabel?)`** — magic-link semantics + attempt counter (decision 6, commit-then-throw):
```ts
const signInWithOtp = mutation(async (ctx, { email, code, deviceLabel }: { email: string; code: string; deviceLabel?: string }) => {
  if (!config.email) throw new EmailNotConfiguredError();
  const { row, normEmail, matches } = await peekCode(ctx, email, "otp", code);
  if (!row) throw new Error(INVALID);                        // no row at all → generic (no counter to bump)
  if (!matches) {
    // Wrong (or expired) guess: bump attempts; at the cap DELETE the row (lockout). commit-then-throw
    // so the increment/delete COMMITS despite the throw (same mechanism as A1's lockout).
    const attempts = (row.attempts as number) + 1;
    if (attempts >= config.email.otpAttempts) await ctx.db.delete(row._id as string);
    else await ctx.db.replace(row._id as string, { ...row, attempts });
    return commitThenThrow(INVALID);
  }
  await ctx.db.delete(row._id as string);                   // consume-before-validate winner
  return adoptOrCreateThenMint(ctx, config, normEmail, deviceLabel);
});
```
> OTP's expiry: an expired-but-present row that the user guesses correctly still goes through the `!matches` branch (because `peekCode` checks expiry), so it bumps the counter and throws generic invalid — expired = generic invalid, row cleaned up on cap or on a subsequent correct-shape guess. Acceptable; a wrong guess against an expired row is indistinguishable from a live one (anti-enum-consistent).

### Tests (`email-redeem.test.ts`)
- **verify mints + sets emailVerified:** request→redeem returns a token; the user row's `emailVerified === true`.
- **single-use / replay:** a consumed code fails on a second redeem (generic invalid).
- **concurrent redeem → one winner:** fire two `signInWithMagicLink` with the same token concurrently (`Promise.allSettled`) → exactly one fulfilled, one rejected `/invalid code/`. (Under single-writer OCC one delete wins.)
- **expiry:** advance clock past the TTL → redeem = generic `/invalid code/`; row cleaned up.
- **OTP brute force:** `otpAttempts` wrong guesses → the row is deleted; the (previously correct) code then also fails; assert the `attempts` counter survived the failed calls (commit-then-throw durability — privileged-read the row between guesses). Attribution: better-auth email-otp.test.ts (theirs 3; ours 5).
- **OTP matching-email requirement / cross-account:** a code issued for A cannot redeem as B (`peekCode`'s key + guard) → generic invalid. Attribution: convex-auth otp.test.ts:25.
- **reset:** old password dead (A1 `signIn` rejects), new password works, ALL other sessions revoked (open a second session first, assert it's gone via `getUserId`), a fresh session minted; cross-account guard (reset code for A cannot reset B). Attribution: convex-auth passwords.test.ts (reset section) + Password.ts:196.
- **magic/otp create-on-first-use:** unknown email (default flags) → user created, `emailVerified: true`; with `createUsersOnEmailSignIn: false` → generic invalid, no user created.
- **unverified-adoption-clears-password:** password-signUp an unverified account, then magic-link sign-in the same email → the `accounts` password row is gone (A1 `signIn` now rejects with invalid credentials), the user is adopted (same userId). Attribution: better-auth magic-link.test.ts:268.
- **first-proof revokes the parked session (the attack scenario, uniform rule):** attacker password-signUps with the VICTIM's email (unverified) and holds the minted session; victim then requests + redeems a magic link for that email → the attacker's session no longer resolves (`auth:getUserId` with the attacker's token → null), the victim's fresh mint works. Repeat via `verifyEmail` and `signInWithOtp` (all three flip paths enforce the boundary). Rationale attribution: better-auth `revokeUnprovenAccountAccess`.
- **benign inverse — already-verified multi-device sign-in survives:** an `emailVerified: true` user with a live session magic-links (or OTPs) in from a "second device" → the FIRST device's session still resolves (`getUserId` non-null) — no wipe on an already-true `emailVerified` (the rule gates on the false→true flip).

## Task 4 — signUp/signIn verification gate

The `requireEmailVerification` branch on A1's `signUp`/`signIn` (returns `{ needsVerification: true }`, no tokens, no I/O), byte-identical default-false behavior, anonymous-upgrade composition.

### Files
- **Modify** `components/auth/src/functions.ts` — gate branches in `signUp`/`signIn`.
- **Create** `components/auth/test/email-verification-gate.test.ts`.

### Interfaces

The gate return type widens the mint result to a discriminated union — additive, existing callers unaffected when the flag is off:
```ts
export type NeedsVerification = { needsVerification: true };
export type SignInResult = MintResult | NeedsVerification | ReturnType<typeof commitThenThrow>;
```

`signUp` — **new code** (insert the gate right before the final `return mintSession(...)`; the mutation does NO I/O — the client drives the resend by calling `requestEmailVerification`):
```ts
    await ctx.db.insert("accounts", { userId, provider: "password", accountId: normEmail, secret: await hashSecret(password), failedAttempts: 0, lockedUntil: 0 });
    // Verification gate (decision 11): only when configured on AND the account isn't already verified.
    // No tokens, no send here — the CLIENT responds to needsVerification by calling requestEmailVerification.
    // Anonymous-upgrade composes: the upgrade above already ran (userId/rows preserved); the user keeps
    // working anonymously (their old anon session still lives) until verifyEmail mints.
    if (config.email?.requireEmailVerification) {
      const user = await ctx.db.get(userId);
      if (user?.emailVerified !== true) return { needsVerification: true } as NeedsVerification;
    }
    return mintSession(ctx, config, userId, deviceLabel);
```
> **Anonymous-upgrade + gate interaction (ADJUDICATED — handled by the uniform first-proof rule):** A1's `signUp` upgrade path deletes ALL the anon user's sessions BEFORE minting. Under the gate we return `needsVerification` without minting — so the anon-session wipe must NOT run on the gated anon-upgrade branch (the user "keeps working anonymously until verified", spec §"signUp/signIn integration"). Implementation: when `config.email?.requireEmailVerification` is true and the account will be unverified, SKIP the upgrade branch's session-wipe loop; NO deferred-wipe bookkeeping is needed, because `verifyEmail`'s uniform first-proof rule (`markVerifiedRevokingIfFirstProof`, Task 3) deletes ALL the user's sessions — including the surviving anon session — at the moment the mailbox is proven, then mints. The credential boundary is enforced exactly once, at the flip, by one shared code path. This also closes the parked-session hole: if an ATTACKER did the gated signUp with the victim's email, the attacker's still-live anon-upgrade session dies when the victim verifies.

`signIn` — **new code** (after successful password verification, before minting):
```ts
    // Success path (counters reset / legacy rehash already applied above)...
    if (config.email?.requireEmailVerification) {
      const user = await ctx.db.get(account.userId as string);
      if (user?.emailVerified !== true) return { needsVerification: true } as NeedsVerification;
    }
    return mintSession(ctx, config, account.userId as string, deviceLabel);
```

### Tests (`email-verification-gate.test.ts`)
- **gate off (default):** `signUp`/`signIn` return a full mint result (byte-identical A1) — no `needsVerification` key. Reuse the A1 assertions.
- **gate on, signUp:** unverified `signUp` → `{ needsVerification: true }`, NO token; then `requestEmailVerification` + `verifyEmail` → mints; a subsequent `signIn` (now `emailVerified`) → mints directly. Attribution: convex-auth passwords.test.ts:68-113.
- **gate on, signIn of unverified existing account:** → `needsVerification`, no token.
- **anon-upgrade under the gate (uniform rule end-to-end):** anon sign-in → write a row → `signUp` (gate on) → `needsVerification`; the anon session SURVIVES the gate (`getUserId` non-null, anon-written row still reads); then `verifyEmail` mints AND the old anon session DIES at that mint (`getUserId` with the old anon token → null — `markVerifiedRevokingIfFirstProof`'s wipe), while the row survives under the same userId with the fresh session.

## Task 5 — E2E through the real server + auth-demo

`packages/cli/test/auth-email-e2e.test.ts` (in-memory capture provider through the REAL dev server) + the auth-demo UI/flows.

### Files
- **Create** `packages/cli/test/auth-email-e2e.test.ts`.
- **Modify** `examples/auth-demo/stackbase.config.ts` — pass `email: { provider: consoleEmail(), from, appName, baseUrl }` to `defineAuth`/`auth` (switch `auth` → `defineAuth({ email: {...} })`).
- **Modify** `examples/auth-demo/web/main.tsx` — forgot-password, magic-link/OTP sign-in, verify banner (drives `needsVerification`).
- **Modify** `examples/auth-demo/test/flow.test.ts` — add the email flows (capture provider) if the demo's test wiring allows a provider injection; else add a sibling test.
- Regenerate `examples/auth-demo/convex/_generated/*` if the demo's own functions change (they don't — the flows live in the component).

### E2E shape (mirror `auth-session-e2e.test.ts` exactly — `loadProject` + `createEmbeddedRuntime` + `startDevServer` + real `StackbaseClient`/`webSocketTransport`):

- A test-only in-memory capture provider composed via `defineAuth({ email: { provider: capture, from: "no-reply@test", baseUrl: "https://app.test", appName: "Demo" } })`; `capture.sent` is an array the test reads the code/link out of.
- **magic-link round trip:** `client.action(api.auth.requestMagicLink, { email })` → read the token from `capture.sent.at(-1).text` → `client.mutation(api.auth.signInWithMagicLink, { email, token })` → `setAuth(token)` → a live `whoami.get` subscription (opened before) sees the new userId.
- **reset revocation fans out:** sign up + open a `whoami.get` subscription on connection A (authed); on connection B (or via the action) `requestPasswordReset` + `resetPassword` → connection A's subscription flips to `null` (all sessions revoked → the old token's session row is deleted → reactive). Mirror A1 E2E test (1)'s reactive-revoke waitFor idiom.
- **console-provider smoke:** compose `consoleEmail()`, spy `console.log`, run `requestOtp` → the server logs and the action returns `{ sent: true }` (the zero-config path works end to end).

### auth-demo UI
- A "Forgot password?" form → `requestPasswordReset` → a reset-code field → `resetPassword` → `setSession`.
- Magic-link + OTP sign-in tabs → `requestMagicLink`/`requestOtp` → paste-code field → `signInWithMagicLink`/`signInWithOtp` → `setSession`.
- A verify banner shown when a sign-in returns `{ needsVerification: true }`: a "Resend verification" button calling `requestEmailVerification`, and a code field calling `verifyEmail`.
- Console provider is fine for the demo (codes print to the `stackbase dev` console); document that at the top of the demo.

### Verification
```bash
bun run build && bun run --filter @stackbase/cli test         # includes auth-email-e2e
bun run --filter auth-demo test

## Task 6 — Docs + README re-baseline

### Files
- **Modify** `docs/enduser/build/auth.md` — new "Email flows" section.
- **Modify** `components/auth/README.md` — limitations re-baselined (email flows shipped; A3 roadmap → OAuth/JWKS only).

### Content (`docs/enduser/build/auth.md`)
- **Setup:** the `email` block on `defineAuth`; `consoleEmail()` as the zero-config default (codes print to the server console); `resendEmail({ apiKey, from })` for production; the SMTP recipe as a ~15-line custom `{ send }` using `nodemailer` (documented, not a built-in — decision 14).
- **Each flow's client-side usage** (native `@stackbase/*` imports, NOT `convex/*`): verify (`needsVerification` → `requestEmailVerification` → `verifyEmail`), password reset (`requestPasswordReset` → `resetPassword`), magic-link (`requestMagicLink` → `signInWithMagicLink`), OTP (`requestOtp` → `signInWithOtp`). Each redeem returns a mint result the app hands to `createAuthClient.setSession()`.
- **Policy flags:** `requireEmailVerification` (default false), `createUsersOnEmailSignIn` (default true) — what each does, when to flip it.
- **Abuse-defense table:** attempt counter (`otpAttempts` 5), cooldown (`requestCooldownMs` 60s → `EMAIL_COOLDOWN`), global throttle (`emailSendsPerMinute` 100, 0 disables → `EMAIL_THROTTLED`), anti-enumeration (`{ sent: true }` always; generic invalid at redeem), first-mailbox-proof session revocation (the first time an account's email is proven — verify/magic/OTP — all pre-existing sessions are revoked, so a pre-registrant's parked session can't survive; already-verified sign-ins are normal multi-device and keep other sessions). Note the deliberate absence of per-IP limits (no transport identifiers by design).
- **Code shapes / TTLs table:** OTP 8 digits / 10min; magic 32-char / 1h; reset 32-char / 1h; verify 32-char / 24h.

### README re-baseline
- Move "email verification / password reset / magic-link / OTP" from limitations to shipped; A3 note becomes "OAuth + JWKS/OIDC (external identity)" only.

### Verification
```bash
bun run build && bun run typecheck && bun run test
```

## Resolved ambiguities (for controller adjudication)

1. **Where the raw code is generated (the headline determinism question) — RESOLVED: inside `_issueCode` (the mutation), returned to the action.** A1's `mintSession` (`components/auth/src/functions.ts:44-69`) already generates the raw session token via `generateToken()` (`randomBytes(32)`, `node:crypto`) INSIDE a mutation and returns the raw value to its caller — the exact precedent. The "no `Math.random()`/`Date.now()` in mutations" rule targets `Math.random()` and wall-clock ordering (`ctx.now()` is the deterministic clock, used for all TTL/cooldown/window math); a `node:crypto` CSPRNG minting a one-shot unsent secret inside a mutation is A1-established and correct (an OCC re-run just mints a fresh unsent secret). Generating action-side and passing IN was REJECTED: it would split ownership of "the value emailed" from "the hash stored", inviting divergence, and the spec itself says "_issueCode … returns the raw code + send-decision to the action." So `_issueCode` owns generation, hashing, storage, AND the returned raw code.

2. **Internal-mutation-from-action calling convention — FOUND: `ctx.runMutation("auth:_issueCode", args)`, `_`-prefixed module, verbatim mirror of `scheduler`.** `components/scheduler/src/facade.ts:307` calls `api.runMutation("scheduler:_enqueue", …)`; `components/scheduler/src/modules.ts` registers `_enqueue` as a normal `mutation` in the module map under key `_enqueue` → path `scheduler:_enqueue`. The `_` prefix makes it non-client-callable (public `runtime.run` blocks `_`; executor.ts:82) but reachable from an action's `runMutation` (which routes through `InlineUdfExecutor.runActionFn`'s `run("mutation")` → `invoke(path,…)`, executor.ts:702-703, permitting `_`). Auth's `request*` actions therefore call `ctx.runMutation("auth:_issueCode", { email, flow })` with `_issueCode` registered in `makeEmailModules`'s returned map. NOTE: unlike scheduler (which uses the `buildAction` ContextProvider seam for a facade method), auth's `request*` are ordinary `action()` functions in the module set — no `buildAction`/ContextProvider needed; they use the plain `ctx.runMutation` on the action ctx directly.

3. **Component test harness — using the SHIPPED A1 idiom (`composeComponents` + `EmbeddedRuntime.create` + `r.run`), NOT `createTestStackbase`.** The spec's Testing section says "`@stackbase/test`," but every shipped A1 auth component test (`lockout.test.ts`, `sign-up-in.test.ts`, etc.) uses `composeComponents([auth]) → EmbeddedRuntime.create → r.run("auth:…")`. A2 needs to inject a capture provider, which is trivial with `defineAuth({ email: { provider: capture, from } })` composed the same way. Following the proven, consistent idiom; noted so the controller can redirect to `createTestStackbase` if desired (no behavioral difference).

4. **`emailVerified` on password reset — set to `true`. ADJUDICATED: accepted.** Spec decision 12 mandates `emailVerified: true` for magic/otp/verify and is silent on reset; the plan sets it on `resetPassword` too (a reset proves mailbox control identically). Composes trivially with the uniform first-proof rule (5a below) because reset already revokes ALL sessions unconditionally (decision 8) — the boundary the flip demands is satisfied by reset's own wipe.

5. **Anonymous-upgrade + verification-gate session survival. ADJUDICATED: accepted, and generalized into a uniform rule (5a).** A1's `signUp` upgrade path deletes all anon sessions before minting; under `requireEmailVerification` the gate returns `needsVerification` without minting, so Task 4 SKIPS the anon-session wipe on the gated branch (the user keeps working anonymously) — with NO deferred-wipe special-casing, because the boundary is enforced by 5a at `verifyEmail`'s mint.

5a. **Uniform rule (adjudicated amendment): "first mailbox proof is a credential boundary."** ANY flow that flips `users.emailVerified` false→true (`verifyEmail`, `signInWithMagicLink`, `signInWithOtp`) deletes ALL the user's existing sessions (byUserId) before minting — extending spec decision 10 (which only cleared the password). Closes the parked-session backdoor: an attacker who pre-created the unverified account (gated anon-upgrade or plain unverified signUp) and parked a live session would otherwise keep it after the true mailbox owner proves control (better-auth's `revokeUnprovenAccountAccess` revokes sessions for exactly this reason). Gated on the FLIP, so an already-verified user's magic/OTP sign-in from a second device is normal multi-device and wipes nothing. Implemented as one shared helper (`markVerifiedRevokingIfFirstProof`, Task 3) used by all three flip paths; tested by the attack-scenario + benign-inverse pair (Task 3) and the gated-anon end-to-end test (Task 4).
