/**
 * Cross-process commit propagation for a Postgres-backed fleet (scale-seam #4, multi-process
 * variant): the in-memory `EmbeddedWriteFanoutAdapter` only fans a commit out within ONE process.
 * `NotifyingFanoutAdapter` wraps it so every publish ALSO does `pg_notify('stackbase_commits', …)`,
 * and `CommitTailer` on each follower LISTENs for that channel (plus a wall-clock poll fallback,
 * since NOTIFY delivery is not guaranteed while a listener connection is reconnecting) and derives
 * exactly what changed since its own watermark by reading the `indexes` MVCC log directly —
 * no in-process `OplogDelta` ever crosses a process boundary.
 *
 * `DerivedInvalidation.writtenKeys` carries raw `(indexId, key)` pairs, not point ranges — the
 * conversion into the sync handler's `WriteInvalidation.writtenRanges` shape happens where the
 * handler's range/key-codec types are already in scope (the caller wiring this to
 * `onInvalidation`), not here.
 *
 * `DerivedInvalidation.writtenDocs` carries the DOCUMENT-keyspace half of the same picture:
 * `indexes` rows only cover a write transitively (via whichever indexes happen to exist on the
 * table, and NOT AT ALL for a pure delete — see `postgres-docstore.ts`'s `write()`, a "Deleted"
 * index entry carries no `table_id`/`internal_id`), so a subscription that reads via a bare
 * `ctx.db.get(id)` — which records its read range in the document keyspace, not any index
 * keyspace, see `single-writer-transactor.ts`'s `docKeyspace()`/`TransactionContextImpl.get()` —
 * would never be invalidated by deriving from `indexes` alone. The `documents` table is written
 * unconditionally for every put AND delete (`DocumentLogEntry`, `postgres-docstore.ts`'s
 * `write()`), so querying it directly is the one source that provably reproduces the local
 * commit path's document-keyspace write ranges 1:1, independent of what indexes exist.
