/**
 * Task 4 design note — `parentId` threading (cascading cancel):
 *
 * The original design was for the driver to set an ambient "current job id" while running a job,
 * so a job scheduling a child (`ctx.scheduler.runAfter(...)` called from inside a driver-run job)
 * would have that child's `parentId` populated automatically via `currentJobId()` below. That
 * requires the ambient to survive from `driver.ts`'s `runPass()` — which only has the string
 * `fnPath`/`jobId`, and calls `ctx.runFunction(claimed.fnPath, claimed.args)` — through
 * `DriverContext.runFunction` → `InlineUdfExecutor.run` → this component's `context` builder,
 * none of which currently carry a "who's calling" field. Wiring it soundly means extending
 * `DriverContext.runFunction`'s signature, `RunOptions` (`packages/executor/src/executor.ts`),
 * and `ComponentContext` (used by every `context:` facade, not just this one) — a cross-package
 * change well outside `components/scheduler/*` with blast radius on every component, for a single
 * driver's benefit.
 *
 * Chosen instead: cascading cancel is implemented generically over whatever `parentId` a job
 * happens to have (`cancel()` below walks `by_parent` regardless of how `parentId` got set), and
 * `currentJobId()` stays a stub returning `undefined`. Known limitation: a child scheduled from
 * *inside* a driver-run job today gets `parentId: undefined` (not chained) — cascading cancel
 * only reaches jobs whose `parentId` was set explicitly. The test suite (`test/reliability.test.ts`)
 * exercises the cascade via the test-only `_system:insertJob` escape hatch, which sets `parentId`
 * directly. Revisit if/when a later slice needs real parent/child chaining from driver-run jobs.
