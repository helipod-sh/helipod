/**
 * The reactive sync protocol — the client↔server message catalog and the version model.
 *
 * State is **version-bracketed**: every `Transition` advances `startVersion → endVersion`,
 * and a client applies one only if its `startVersion` matches the client's current version.
 * A missed frame leaves a gap the client detects and resyncs from — so dropping a frame
 * (backpressure) degrades to a resync, never to silent divergence. The `ServerMessage` union
 * is versioned-by-shape and deliberately extensible (e.g. the non-commit `Broadcast` kind for
 * the ephemeral path) so the wire can later gain a binary delta encoding.

  // recomputes the sub's value/byId/range from scratch (e.g. a `SetAuth` refresh) rather than

  // `changes` when `reset` is present, exactly like the initial-subscribe case, instead of merging
  // onto whatever map it had — a re-baseline can legitimately swap which document(s) the sub even
  // tracks (an identity-scoped `db.get` whose target id changes under a `SetAuth`), so applying it

  // of an already-shipped path are left untouched on principle). DLR 2b's new DIFFABLE_RANGE reset
  // emits the richer `{ mode: "range", orderDir }` descriptor instead, since a range client needs to
  // know it's rebuilding an ORDERED list (and in which direction), not a single row. A client that
  // only checks `reset` for truthiness (the only pattern used anywhere today) treats both forms
