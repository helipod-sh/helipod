/**
 * The reactive sync protocol — the client↔server message catalog and the version model.
 *
 * State is **version-bracketed**: every `Transition` advances `startVersion → endVersion`,
 * and a client applies one only if its `startVersion` matches the client's current version.
 * A missed frame leaves a gap the client detects and resyncs from — so dropping a frame
 * (backpressure) degrades to a resync, never to silent divergence. The `ServerMessage` union
 * is versioned-by-shape and deliberately extensible (e.g. the non-commit `Broadcast` kind for
 * the ephemeral path) so the wire can later gain a binary delta encoding.
