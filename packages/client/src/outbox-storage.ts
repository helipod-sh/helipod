/**
 * The `OutboxStorage` seam — the client's first storage API (verdict §(d), `docs/dev/research/
 * offline-outbox/verdict.md`). Two implementations: `memoryOutbox()` (the default — preserves
 * today's behavior byte-for-byte; nothing persists across a reload) and `indexedDBOutbox()`
 * (probe-and-fallback: real durability in a browser, transparently degrades to `memoryOutbox()`
 * wherever IndexedDB is unavailable or fails to open — Node, private-mode Safari, a corrupt
 * origin). Durability is opt-in constructor config (`new StackbaseClient(transport, { outbox:
 * indexedDBOutbox() })`); a client constructed without `outbox` never touches this file's runtime
 * branches that matter — `memoryOutbox()`'s Maps are just as ephemeral as the pre-outbox client.
 *
 * Persisted record shape is verdict §(d) verbatim: `{clientId, seq, requestId, udfPath, args, seed,
 * order, status, identityFingerprint, outboxVersion, enqueuedAt}`. `order` is an explicit column —
 * Map/array insertion order does not survive IndexedDB, and the drain (a later task) needs a
 * persisted total order across the WHOLE shared queue (every clientId sharing this database), not
 * just within one clientId's entries.
 *
 * Identity (verdict §(d) "Identity", hazard 8): **one clientId per tab-session, minted at client
 * construction, never reused across a reload.** A fresh `StackbaseClient` instance always mints a
 * BRAND NEW clientId — there is no reseed protocol, so there is nothing to get wrong (hazard 8:
 * "reload resets counters — dissolved structurally"). Entries persisted under an OLDER clientId
 * from a previous session are untouched by minting a new one; they hydrate and drain under their
 * own **recorded** `(clientId, seq)` pair later (a later task's drain). The "-or-loaded" half of
 * `mintIdentity` concerns `nextSeq`, not `clientId`: a fresh clientId's meta row does not exist, so
 * `nextSeq` starts at 0 — but the loader still calls `getMeta` first rather than assuming absence,
 * so a colliding clientId (astronomically unlikely — see `defaultMintClientId`) resumes from its
 * recorded `nextSeq` instead of silently reusing a seq that already named a payload (verdict §(b)'s
 * governing invariant: the map `(clientId, seq) -> payload` is written exactly once).
