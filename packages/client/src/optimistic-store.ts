/**
 * T5 — the public, typed `OptimisticLocalStore` (verdict §(b)). Wraps T4's internal, untyped
 * `OptimisticStoreView` (the raw read/write composed-state view `LayeredQueryStore.recompose`
 * threads through an updater) with the v1 API surface a `withOptimisticUpdate` closure actually
 * sees:
 *
 *  - **Typed `getQuery`/`setQuery`/`getAllQueries`** — `Q`'s declared `__args`/`__returns` (a
 *    codegen-generated `FunctionReference`) drive `args`/`value`'s types; the client's own untyped
 *    `{ __path }` ref or a raw string path fall back to `Record<string, Value>`/`Value` (see
 *    `RefArgs`/`RefReturn` below — the same fallback shape `api.ts`'s `AnyFunctionRef` bridges).
 *  - **`placeholderId(table)`** — deterministic per (entry, table, call-ordinal): replaying the
 *    SAME pending mutation (same `entry.seed`, verdict §(c) event 2d's rebuild) mints the SAME id
 *    sequence, while two calls to `placeholderId("messages")` within ONE updater invocation are
 *    ordinal-distinct, and two DIFFERENT entries (distinct `seed.entropy`) never collide. Built from
 *    `entry.seed.entropy` — NOT `crypto.randomUUID()` (verdict D11's replay-purity rule; Convex's
 *    own docs example is the footgun this API shape is designed to make structurally impossible to
 *    reach for).
 *  - **`now()`** — `entry.seed.now`, fixed at mutation creation, stable across every replay. NOT
 *    `Date.now()` (same D11 rule).
 *  - **dev-mode `Object.freeze`** on every value `getQuery`/`getAllQueries` hands back — Convex's
 *    documented "mutating the returned value in place will corrupt the client's internal state"
 *    footgun becomes an immediate `TypeError` in development (strict-mode ESM) instead of silent
 *    corruption. Gated on `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` (no existing dev/prod convention
 *    was found in this package at T1 — this is the convention going forward) so a production build
 *    pays no freeze cost.
