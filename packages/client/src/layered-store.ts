 * the surviving optimistic updates over that base — what listeners and the cached first delivery
 * see). Change detection is by **reference inequality**, exactly as convex-js does.
 *
 * The **byte-identity invariant** (the no-re-render binding): when NO surviving update touches a
 * query, its `composedValue` must be the *same reference* as its `serverValue`, not merely
 * deep-equal — so a client with zero optimistic updates behaves reference-for-reference like the
 * pre-slice client and triggers no extra renders.
 *
 * `recompose` is the sole place composed values are (re)built. It is transactional per-updater:
 * an updater that throws mid-run contributes NOTHING (its buffered writes are discarded) and is
 * reported for the caller to drop — a mid-rebuild throw never leaves the composed store half-built.
